    "A custom meta-algorithm I like to call \"Two-Handed optimization\". We have two sub-algorithms (in this case random search and gradient descent) and we vary which we use depending on how well each algorithm is performing: the better it's doing, the more we use it. The theory is that by having one exploratory algorithm (RS) and one exploitative algorithm (GD) we can better solve the explore-exploit problem by automating the decision as to which algorithm to use with a mesa optimizer."

    "In this notebook we'll test the semi-empirical mass formula. It's a formula from physics which gives us the binding energy of a nucleus given its proton number, Z, and neutron number, N. Since physics is effectively trying to maximise the binding energy per nucleon, we have a fun optimization problem if we divide the energy predicted by the SEMF by Z + N. You can play around with physics and see which isotopes would be stable if you changed, say, the Coulomb term! \n",
    "\n",
    "SEMF is also useful since it has a known best result of Nickel-62: Z = 28, N = 34. The closer the output is to this, the better our algorithm is doing. Another very stable isotope is Iron-56: Z = 26, N = 30, so if we get a result close to this the algorithm has done well, too.\n",
