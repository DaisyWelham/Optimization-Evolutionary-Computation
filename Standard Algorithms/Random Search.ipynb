    "Random Search (RS) is one of the easiest optimization algorithms to understand: pick a random hypothesis, and keep only the best! It isn't technically Bayesian since the next guess has nothing to do with the previous guess, but it's a start. RS is a nice benchmark against which to compare other algorithms, since it's computationally cheap and takes little effort to implement: any algorithm which doesn't beat RS is probably not worth dealing with!"

    "In this notebook we'll test the semi-empirical mass formula. It's a formula from physics which gives us the binding energy of a nucleus given its proton number, Z, and neutron number, N. Since physics is effectively trying to maximise the binding energy per nucleon, we have a fun optimization problem if we divide the energy predicted by the SEMF by Z + N. You can play around with physics and see which isotopes would be stable if you changed, say, the Coulomb term! \n",
    "\n",
    "SEMF is also useful since it has a known best result of Nickel-62: Z = 28, N = 34. The closer the output is to this, the better our algorithm is doing. Another very stable isotope is Iron-56: Z = 26, N = 30, so if we get a result close to this the algorithm has done well, too.\n",
